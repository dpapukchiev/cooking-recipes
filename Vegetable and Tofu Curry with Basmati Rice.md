#### **Instructions**
1. **Cook the Rice**:
   - Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear.
   - Combine rice and water in a pot. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer until water is absorbed and rice is cooked. Set aside.

2. **Prepare the Tofu**:
   - Marinate tofu cubes in soya sauce for 10 minutes.
   - Air-fry or bake at 200°C (400°F) for 10-12 minutes until crispy.

3. **Prepare the Sauce (Base for Both Tofu and Curry)**:
   - In a small bowl, mix red curry paste, soya sauce, peanut butter, chili flakes, and maple syrup. Stir in tapioca flour mixture to thicken.
   - Use half of this sauce to coat the crispy tofu, ensuring it is well glazed.

4. **Prepare the Curry Sauce**:
   - To the remaining sauce, add rind broth and MSG. Stir well to combine.

5. **Cook the Vegetables**:
   - Heat oil in a large pan or wok over medium heat.
   - Sauté onions and garlic until fragrant.
   - Add zucchini, bell pepper, carrots, and broccoli. Stir-fry for 5-7 minutes until tender-crisp.

6. **Combine Everything**:
   - Pour the curry sauce over the vegetables, stirring well to coat. Let simmer for 3-4 minutes.
   - Stir in the glazed tofu and cook for another 2 minutes.

7. **Serve**:
   - Plate the cooked rice and top with the vegetable and tofu curry.
   - Garnish with lime juice, teriyaki sauce, and a generous sprinkle of sesame seeds.

#### **Notes**
- The sauce is used twice: first to coat the tofu, then with broth and MSG added for the curry.
- Customize vegetable options as preferred.
- Adjust the spice level by modifying red curry paste and chili flakes.
